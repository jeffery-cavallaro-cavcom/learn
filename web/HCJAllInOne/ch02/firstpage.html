    In the beginning, Tim created the HyperText Markup Language.  The Internet
    was without form and void, and text was upon the face of the monitor and
    the hands of Tim were moving over the face of the keyboard.  And Tim said,
    Let there be links; and there were links. And Tim saw that the links were
    good; and Tim separated the links from the text.  Tim called the links
    anchors, and the text he called other stuff.  And the whole thing together
    was the first web page.
